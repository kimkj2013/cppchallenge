# Hello, C++!
So you want to start coding in C++, right? Okay, we can start!

First of all, there is a file named `hello`. If you see that, type `./hello` in your console. What do you see? What is prompted on your screen?

Next, try `./hello <your_name>` where you put your first name at `<your_name>`. What do you see? What is prompted on your screen?

Now, type `more hello.c`. You will see the source code of the program you have executed just before. Did you get how it flows?
