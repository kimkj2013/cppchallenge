## How-to
Create GitHub account unless you have one, and fork this repository. Clone your forked repository to anywhere in your PC and start solving questions. I prefer you to use Linux, but using Visual Studio on Windows is still okay.

## If you are stuck...
* Don't hesitate to search for documentations. Good programmers always review whatever they have either learnt or forgot. Official documentations are more preferred than 'unofficial' ones.
* If you can't still solve this question or find a bug on a code, contact me immediately.
